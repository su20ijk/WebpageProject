                    <b><i>ROSES ARE RED </i></b>All the seniors involved in the Spring Play gathered
                    around at the end of the last show to receive roses from Mrs. Schiro to
                    commemorate their experience. After they got their roses, Mrs. Schiro gave
                    a small speech thanking and inspiring the seniors for their future lives.
                    “Mrs. Schiro is sone of the nicest ladies I have ever met and I was really
                    flattered she got us all gifts.” said John McCloskey (‘14). FACE IT Owen
                    Musser, played by Kevin Fuller (‘17), intimidates Betty, played by Sophie
                    Michalski (‘18), and Ellard, played by John McCloskey (‘15). In this scene
                    Owen was threatening Betty that he would bring the Ku Klux Klan to her
                    house. “This was the hardest scene to be in because I always wanted to
                    laugh at Kevin’s face!” said Sophie Michalski (‘18).

                “There’s a foreigner in town!”
                It was with these opening lines from a student-written
                song that kick-started Brookfield Central’s Spring Play,
                The Foreigner. The Bluegrass Band that held the audience’s
                attention also filled the down-time during intermission and
                during scene changes, becoming an integral part of the cast.
                During auditions, Mrs. Schiro, the director of the play, brought
                together six students for this band. Each of the girls brought
                their own unique sound with different instruments.
                “At the first practice, we had some issues. With such
                a mix of instruments, we had to work to get them to sound
                right together,” said Riley Swart (‘18), player of the ukulele.
                This student-run group worked everyday after school. They
                played six different songs, including one composed and written
                entirely by the group. These six songs were played on the
                ukulele, cello, guitar, piano, tambourine, and cabasa.
                “It was amazing how quickly we got through songs and
                how much each person contributed to the band! It was so great
                to still be able to perform with less time commitment,” recalled
                Vicky Tarakanova (‘17). Even with the small time commitment,
                they were still able to put on a great show.
                “The band really stole the show, especially with the theme
                song they wrote,” said Rae Davel (‘17), who was a townsperson in
                the play.
                “It was fun to hear them perform before the show started.
                It made us more excited backstage,” said Dylan Pashke (‘16) who
                worked on stage crew for the play. Overall, the BCHS Georgia
                Hills Bluegrass Band was a success that gave this year’s Spring
                Play a step above all previous productions.
