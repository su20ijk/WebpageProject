            After qualifying for state in the 2014, the Brookfield Central<br />
            Boys golf team took a huge hit, losing 60 percent of their<br />
            starting lineup. The only returning members were Sean<br />
            Yun (‘16) and Josh Trasser (‘16). The three vacant spots in the<br />
            lineup were filled up by Kevin Hershberger (‘16), Brandon<br />
            Talaska (‘17), and Zach Mindel (‘18). Even with the huge<br />
            change, the boys began the season with the same goals as<br />
            the previous year: win conference, qualify for state, and be<br />
            successful.<br />
            The future of the team might have looked bleak to most,<br />
            but Yun never doubted them. “We had many guys from last<br />
            year’s reserve team that were ready to play,” He said. Talaska<br />
            agreed, “I was so motivated to work my heart out and<br />
            improve, as did everyone else.”<br />
            With this attitude, the team approached every<br />
            opportunity as positively as it could. Even though the boys<br />
            did not meet the first two goals on the list, they were still<br />
            able to achieve the third. They might not have placed first<br />
            in the GMC, but all of the athletes achieved new personal<br />
            bests in their high school careers. Talaska had a 39 at the<br />
            3rd Conference mini-meet, Mindel an 83 at sectionals,<br />
            Hershberger a 79 at regionals, and Yun a 74 at the Waukesha<br />
            County Championship. They might not have qualified for<br />
            state, but they sent Trasser, who, after shooting his career-<br />
            best 76 at sectionals, moved on as an individual. He finished<br />
            the season ranked 21st in the Wisconsin.<br />
            Looking back, Yun and Talaska were not disappointed.<br />
            Yun explained, “Although struggled, we are proud of our<br />
            season. We worked hard and will continue to work hard and<br />
            even better next year.”<br />
