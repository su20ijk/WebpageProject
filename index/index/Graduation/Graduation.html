                    Waking up on graduation day is terrifying. Every senior knows that it’s the last day that he or she will ever be considered a high school student. After 7 years of seeing the same people, it’s daunting to think that graduation day is the last time the entire class of 2015 will be together, in the same room, in the same school. No matter how excited each person is to graduate and move on to bigger things, no one can help but feel a twinge of nostalgia the moment they enter the gym and realize that this - this understated gathering of parents in folding chairs and students in robes - is the end.
                    “Waking up every morning and getting to spend eight hours a day with the people you love is something I will always cherish,” Michael Dobrzynski (‘15) recalled. “All of my friends... can’t believe how many memories we made.”
                    When thinking back on graduation day, Grace Dunn (‘15) commented, “It was over. It was great to spend one last day with everyone, but then I realized. Seeing each other everyday? That wouldn’t happen anymore and it was sad.”
                    After all, graduation day is the day that seniors become freshmen, high schoolers become college kids. “It was sad to think that at the end of the summer, I would be saying goodbye to everyone. I’ve been friends some people since second grade, and I watched them go off and start their new lives,” remembered Kaitlyn Peksa (‘15).
                    Graduation day was the last day when the Class of 2015 were still seniors. It was the last time they would sit together as Brookfield Central students, as high schoolers. When the day was done, they would predict their future, see themselves moving on, and say goodbye to high school forever.

            LEE-VE IT ALL BEHIND  Daniel Lee (‘15), class treasurer, informs the class and the rest of the audience of the class gift. The class of 2015 voted to use the money they had raised over the past four years to replace the sound system  of the Football field with a newer, higher-quality one.   THE LAST SONG The senior choir members, including Shea Singer (‘15), Dawid Krynicki (‘15), Natalie Hilmer (‘15), Jessica Richards (‘15) and Leah Peavler (‘15) sing their last song together as a high school choir.  #SELFIE  As class president Joey Baker (15’) stands in front of everyone giving his presidential declaration, many giggle and laugh as hundreds of selfies flip in the background. During graduation practice, Joey made a deal with Mr. Gruetzmacher, that if over 50% of the students tweeted a selfie then he would shave his head. Although the class exceeded their 50%, Mr. Gruetzmacher did not shave his head.
